# Implementation Plan: Documentation Folder Structure

## Phase 1: Directory Scaffolding
- [x] Create a new directory named `docs` in the project root.
- [x] Create a subdirectory within `docs` for the initial feature. For example: `docs/flowstate`.

## Phase 2: Content Migration and Creation
- [x] Move the existing `PLAN.md` file for the "FlowState" feature into the `/docs/flowstate` directory.
- [x] Move the existing `CHECKLIST.md` file for the "FlowState" feature into the `/docs/flowstate` directory.
- [x] Create a feature-specific `README.md` for the "FlowState" feature and place it in the `/docs/flowstate` directory.

## Phase 3: Finalize Standards
- [x] Create a `README.md` file at the root of the `/docs` directory to explain the new documentation structure and conventions.
- [x] Create a template directory (`/docs/_template`) containing blank versions of `README.md`, `PLAN.md`, and `CHECKLIST.md` for future use.
- [ ] Announce the new documentation standard to the development team. *(Pending: requires human action)*
